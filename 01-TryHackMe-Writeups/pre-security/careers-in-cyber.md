## 1. Objective
This room provides an overview of the various career paths within the cybersecurity industry.
The industry is currently experiencing high demand (with over 3.5 million unfilled positions) and offers competitive salaries. The objective is to understand the differences between defensive, offensive, and investigative roles to determine the right learning path.

## 2. Defensive Roles (Blue Team)
These roles focus on protecting organizations, building security systems, and responding to attacks.

### Security Analyst
* **Focus:** Monitoring and Reporting.
* **Responsibilities:** Analyzes company networks, compiles reports on incidents, and works with stakeholders to understand security requirements.
* **Relevance:** This is my immediate career target for Phase 2 (SOC Analyst).

### Security Engineer
* **Focus:** Building and Implementation.
* **Responsibilities:** Develops security solutions, addresses network/web application threats, and implements systems to mitigate risks.
* **Relevance:** This is my long-term career goal for Phase 3.

### Incident Responder
* **Focus:** Firefighting (Rapid Reaction).
* **Responsibilities:** Responds to security breaches in real-time. Works under high pressure to detect (MTTD) and recover (MTTR) systems to safeguard the company's reputation and finances.

### Digital Forensics Examiner
* **Focus:** Post-Crime Investigation.
* **Responsibilities:** Collects digital evidence (like a detective) for law enforcement or internal corporate investigations, while strictly adhering to legal procedures.

### Malware Analyst
* **Focus:** Reverse Engineering.
* **Responsibilities:** Analyze suspicious programs (malware) to understand how they work. Requires strong low-level programming skills (Assembly/C).

## 3. Offensive Roles (Red Team)
These roles focus on simulating attacks to find security gaps before criminals do.

### Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker)
* **Focus:** Finding Vulnerabilities.
* **Responsibilities:** Conducts penetration tests on systems, networks, and web applications to uncover flaws and reports them for remediation.

### Red Teamer
* **Focus:** Testing Response & Stealth.
* **Responsibilities:** Similar to a Pentester but more specific: emulates the behavior of real threat actors to test the Blue Team's detection capabilities. The goal is not just to find flaws, but to test how fast the company realizes they are being attacked.

## 4. Conclusion & My Path
This room clarified the career map for me. Although Offensive roles appear exciting ("hacking"), I have chosen the Defensive path due to my interest in system architecture and protection.

**My Career Plan:**
1.  **Short-Term:** Master Security Analyst skills to understand how to detect attacks.
2.  **Long-Term:** Evolve into a Security Engineer to build secure systems from the ground up.
